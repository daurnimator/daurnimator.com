<p>It&rsquo;s great to run tests on your code <em>before</em> you commit it. It&rsquo;s even better to make that happen automatically!</p>

<p>git lets you run a script before a commit succeeds by creating what is known as a &ldquo;pre-commit&rdquo; hook; it&rsquo;s simply an executable located at <code>.git/hooks/pre-commit</code>.</p>

<p>However, there are a few gotchas: by default, git will just run it against your current (possibly dirty) checkout. To make sure you&rsquo;re actually testing the code you&rsquo;re about to commit, we can stash your other changes while the tests run.</p>

<p>This brings up another issue: that popping a git stash that includes an index will often result in conflicts; we can solve this by using <code>git reset --hard</code> before we pop from the stash.</p>

<p>One last thing: we want to recover to the original directory state no matter what happens (e.g. maybe our test suite itself fails); so we use a bash <code>trap</code> to ensure that our stash popping happens no-matter the exit path.</p>

<p>With that all said, here is what I use as a pre-commit hook for my lua projects:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
set -eufo pipefail

if [ -n "$(git status -z)" ]; then
    git stash -q --keep-index --include-untracked
    trap "git reset -q --hard &amp;&amp; git stash pop -q --index" EXIT
fi

echo "## Running luacheck"
luacheck .
echo

echo "## Running tests with busted"
busted
echo
</code></pre>
