<p><img alt="My current symbol of easter" src="http://kiwifruit-the-blog.co.nz/images/Lindt%20Bunny.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="246" hspace="2" width="180"/>I&rsquo;m not so into this blog thing&hellip; Wonder if anyone ever even reads this stuff.</p>
<p>Easter has come and gone, with a mild amount of chocolate digested. The birth of zombie jesus was remembered by some, for others, easter just brought an overwhelming amount of advertising about rabbits with eggs came into their lives.</p>
<p>Anyway, latest and greatest is a dead hard drive(s), having lots of fun getting that going again. ddrescue to the&hellip;. rescue. Hopefully haven&rsquo;t lost anything; recovered all of my boot drive, but another drive isn&rsquo;t as lucky it seems, though its only stopped working after I fixed the other one!</p>

Engineering mechanics is quite hard, and not the best taught subject around&hellip; Not sure how well that will come out in the end; calculus 2 is making alot more sense the second time around, probably a good thing, though it is a trudge, and I would much rather to be back in linear algebra. Engineering computation is quite easy, but I&rsquo;m still getting a bit out of it, my C programming skills are less of a hodge podge, a few syntaxy things are now a heck of a lot clearer.</p>
<p>Wish I had some pictures or something, this page is so bland&hellip;. (ok, added some, yay relevance)</p>
