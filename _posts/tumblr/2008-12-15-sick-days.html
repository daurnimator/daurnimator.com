<p>Yay, just as summer comes, and I&rsquo;m ready to go out and do anything and everything, I get glandular fever. Hooray.</p>
<p>Spose I was going to be inside anyway - I WAS going to get my wisdom teeth out now anyway (but they can&rsquo;t, cause my throat is closed over!)</p>
<p>Currently stuck on heavy painkillers, hoping it will go away by christmas.</p>
