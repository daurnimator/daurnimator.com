<p>Ok, well, the new linux install failed, couldn&rsquo;t get it to boot from grub no matter what I did. Shall leave THAT problem for another day.</p>



<p>In other news, I&rsquo;ve finally replaced my iphone. It has been replaced by the lowly nokia 7210, and (to be delivered shortly) a sansa fuze.</p>



<p>The Nokia 7210 SuperNova is quite a nice phone, and for only $159 (from AllPhones), its quite the bargain. Only a Series 40 phone, but thats all I need. Only thing I miss is wifi, I liked sshing in to my comp from random places :P Would now cost a fortune over gprs. I&rsquo;ve already mistakenly clocked up $13.86 in GPRS charges, it seems that its $1.32 per something - more than a minute, and can&rsquo;t be more than per 10KB&hellip;.. Trying to figure out how to disable it permanently on the phone, and even get it barred on the carrier side. So far have found no relevant menu options :(</p>



<p>With any luck, I&rsquo;ll be able to get rockbox going on the fuze, but thats still to be delivered (and investigated).</p>
