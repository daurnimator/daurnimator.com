<p>So, for a subject at uni (<a href="https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2010/431-302">Digital System Design</a>), we have to learn and use vhdl. Not the best language ever invented (who the hell bases a language on Ada anyway&hellip;. ew), but I suppose it gets the job done.</p>
<p>We learnt using modelsim and quartus on the uni computers, and from the very start I thought they were terrible, terrible programs. Modelsim seems to freeze regulary during simple tasks, highlighting leaves much to be desired, compiling is extremly awkward and half the time was spent trying procedures in a slightly different order to get things compiled/running.</p>
<p>The other night while at home I decided to give the <a href="http://ghdl.free.fr/">GHDL</a> suite a go, and god am I glad I did. Being able to debug in several steps was a great improvement, and gtkwave is a great waveform viewer, or at least it is for all the assignments we get for this subject. No longer do I have to use uni computers, or use the expensive ugly beast that is modelsim.</p>
<p>I sort of enjoyed working in vhdl for a little bit there&hellip;</p>
