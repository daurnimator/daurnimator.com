<a href="https://github.com/daurnimator/lua-systemd">Systemd bindings for Lua</a><br/><p><span>Today I took a dive into systemd, trying to learn how it works, and what features it provides.</span></p>
<p>As I played around with unit files and creating my own services, I started wanting to do it all via lua.Â So I spent the morning writing some C bindings to libsystemd.</p>
<p>The fruits of this labour can be tracked over at <a href="https://github.com/daurnimator/lua-systemd" target="_blank">github </a>and downloaded from <a href="https://rocks.moonscript.org/modules/daurnimator/systemd" target="_blank">moonrocks</a></p>
