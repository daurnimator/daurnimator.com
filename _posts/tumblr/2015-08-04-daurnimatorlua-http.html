<a href="https://github.com/daurnimator/lua-http">daurnimator/lua-http</a><br/><p>Over the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve been working on new lua library in my free time.</p>

<p>Announcing: <strong>&ldquo;lua-http&rdquo;</strong>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a fresh take on a http library for lua.
Designed it with HTTP2 in mind from the start, it caters for both clients and servers.</p>

<p>All network operations are non-blocking, yet also work outside of a coroutine. This allows for lua-http to be used in any lua project, application or script.</p>
