<p>I currently run Xubuntu that was once 7.10, then upgraded to 8.04.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve decided that while I&rsquo;ve got nothing better to do, I&rsquo;ll do a fresh install of ubuntu - the full version this time. Will also use the 64bit version, which I&rsquo;ve been slightly hesitant to use before.</p>



<p>I remember having all sorts of major driver issues every other time I&rsquo;ve installed an operating system on this computer (I have some outdated pci cards); here&rsquo;s hoping that they don&rsquo;t come up again.</p>



<p>I will keep my current xubuntu setup - and <strike>dual</strike>,<strike>tri</strike>,quad boot it (also have xp and osx86 installed). Now to try and find some room on my hdds (that are all full), looks like I&rsquo;ll have to resize my current linux partition&hellip; yay, as least gparted makes it easy.</p>
